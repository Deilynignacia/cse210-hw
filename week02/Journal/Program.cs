// Showing Creativity and Exceeding Requirements
// To demonstrate creativity and exceed the requirements, I implemented three major features. These are:
//
// 1.  Mood Tracking System:
//     - I added a new class, 'HowAreYouFeeling.cs', for daily mood rating, which is displayed after the user chooses to quit (Option 5).
//       It is effective because the user cannot completely quit the program without rating their daily mood. This ensures
//       consistency, making sure that even if they didn't add an entry that day, at least their mood was registered.
//     - It works by converting numerical input (1-5) into descriptive short phrases (e.g., "Terrible üò´"),
//       which are saved to a separate file ('mood_ratings.txt') that is created after the user's first input.
//
// 2.  Robust Character Encoding:
//     - I first tried to implement an emoji tracker, which allowed the user to enter any emoji to rate their day. However, I had trouble
//       getting the user's input to show in the .txt file. Despite this, in my efforts to make this possible, I added a variety of
//       different features, such as ensuring that UTF-8 encoding for console I/O (`Console.OutputEncoding`, `Console.InputEncoding`)
//       and file writing (`StreamWriter` with `new UTF8Encoding(false)`) were used. These attributes ensure proper handling and display
//       of special characters and emojis, not just in the user's input, but also in the program's output, which I considered equally crucial.
//
// 3.  Expanded Prompt List:
//     - I significantly increased the number of random journal prompts, in the file named PromptIdeasGenerator.cs, offering greater 
//       variety to the user.
